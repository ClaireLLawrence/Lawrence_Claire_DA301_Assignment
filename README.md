Module 1 - further models to be used on the data, as some initial models not great in terms of reliability.

Module 2 - 5 clusters appear to be best fit.  To review at a later time.

Module 3 Further Possible Explorations - document term matrix and possible VaderSentiment analysis on top 20 positive/negative reviews to compare sentiment scores.

Module 4 - Further analysis to be done looking at full data set and how variables of genre, platform etc relate.  Product 107 seems to be a top seller and this needs further exploration.

Module 5 - Add new columns to data to filter/subset and create calculated columns for further charts and exploration.  Appears that data is not normally distributed.  There is strong positive correlation between the EU and NA data.
